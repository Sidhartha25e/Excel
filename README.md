🚀 Sidhartha's Excel Playground: Turning Data into Stories
Welcome to my Excel universe! 👋 I'm Sidhartha, a practical soul who loves making sense of everything I see. This repository is where I combine my curiosity and love for Excel to solve real-world problems. It all began with a simple idea: "How can I calculate my own loan better?"

And now, here we are! From personal finance to complex supply chain models, this repository is my sandbox for experimenting, learning, and creating. 🎉

✨ Why this Repository?
This is more than just a collection of Excel files—it's my journey into the world of data. Each project here tells a story, solves a problem, or scratches an itch of curiosity. If you're someone who loves practical solutions and making data dance, you’re in the right place!
